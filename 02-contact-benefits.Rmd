### Dependent Variables

This subsection shows the available responses for the three questions that serve as the basis for our dependent variables. Please note that we recode these variables when we estimate our categorical logit models. For our primary models we collapse the six original categories down into four: 1) Positive views, 2) Negative views, 3) Neutral views, and 4) Don’t know/Decline to answer. This approach has a couple of advantages. First, while we prefer to collect data at a fine-grained level, we have little empirical or theoretical basis for evaluating the substantive difference between the "Somewhat" and "Very" categories. However, there is a clearer and more meaningful distinction between positive and negative views. Second, the simpler saves us a considerable amount of time given the computational intensity of the multilevel categorical models, which we discuss more below.

## Survey Coverage 

Figure \@ref{fig:survey-map} shows the countries included in our analysis and help to illustrate the geographic coverage of our survey. Our initial rules for inclusion were based on a count of the countries that had an average of $\geq100$ U.S. military personnel per year deployed within their borders since 1990. This yielded a fairly large initial sample of 34 countries. From this list we further identified the countries that had average annual deployment levels $\geq$ 10,000 U.S. military personnel (the United Kingdoacm, Germany, Italy, South Korea, and Japan). We added Kuwait to this list as the value fell just below the 10,000 threshold. From there we proceeded to include other countries where the U.S. military presence was likely to be large enough to elicit a reaction from the public, thereby providing the variation we need the conduct our survey. We also focused on countries where the U.S. military had a historically notable presence, or cases that were of contemporary relevance. 

For example, the average value for the Philippines is only 1,042 but the the long historical presence of U.S. military facilities in the Philippines, as well as that country's status as a former colony, makes it an attractive case. Alternatively,  Poland has an average score of 28 U.S. personnel since 1990, but with recent Russian aggression and the increase in U.S. personnel deployed to Poland, this is a case that is of great contemporary relevance for our analysis as it will help us to look at attitudes towards U.S. military personnel in a country that does not have a long-term history of hosting such deployments. 

Other cases, like Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands, and Portugal allow us to assess variation in attitudes among countries that share a relatively similar geographic and political history, as well as countries who all belong to NATO. Further, countries like Portugal provide us with an opportunity to explore how variation in the type of U.S. military personnel affects attitudes, as it receives mostly Navy personnel as compared to the Army-heavy deployments in countries Germany. 

Finally, there is a notable lack of countries represented in Africa and South America. This is for a couple of reasons. First, the only country in South America with a notable history of hosting U.S. military personnel is Panama. However, this is largely due to a brief spike in deployments following the U.S. invasion. In general, most Latin American countries have not played host to large long-term deployments in the way that countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region have. Those deployments that do occur in Latin America are generally short-term military exercises that tend to occur outside of the public's view. Though there is some limited interaction with the public during some of these deployments, it is not of the same frequency or intensity as in other cases. Members of our team have addressed the effects of these types of deployments in other work, but we have opted to exclude them from our current survey effort so as to focus on other cases with a history of hosting larger deployments over long periods of time. 

However, we have conducted fieldwork in two Latin American countries as a part of this project---Panama and Peru. Panama is of clear historic importance given both the Canal and the U.S. invasion in 1989; Peru has hosted multiple rounds of military exercises conducted by the U.S. military in conjunction with other partner countries throughout Latin American on an annual basis. In each case we interviewed U.S. military personnel, local politicians, journalists, and policymakers in an effort to better understand the nature of the U.S. military's activities in these countries, as well as how the U.S. military relates to the host-state public. Given the smaller and more episodic nature of the deployments, we believe these interviews were a more effective approach for covering Latin America than the use of large-N surveys.

Similarly, U.S. longer-term deployments in Africa are relatively new, but most are still relatively small in scale. None of the countries on our base list counting those that averaged $\geq$ 100 personnel per year were in Africa. Furthermore, those that are currently in Africa tend to be oriented towards military training and counter-terror operations. Unlike the larger deployments in Western Europe, these deployments are smaller and more focused in purpose, and do not tend to interact with the host-state population in the ways that deployments in other regions historically have.

## Additional Descriptive Information


One detail that we wanted to convey in the book was just how out of step views of the US government often are compared with views of US military personnel and the American people. Figure \@ref(fig:gov-gap) shows these differences by showing the percent of people in each country who responded with a favorable or unfavorable view of the group listed on the X axis.

For more detail how the countries vary in terms of reported forms of contact and benefits, Table \@ref(tab:contact-benefits-summary) shows the proportion of people responding "Yes" in each country when asked about their contact experience or whether they receive personal economic benefits from a US military presence, or if they know someone who receives such an economic benefit.

## Supplemental Information on Models

### Variables and Model Specifications

In the main text of the book we present the findings from a number of different models. We provide additional information here detailing the specifications of these different models, including data sources and transformations.

The opinion data we use come from a three-year long series of public opinion surveys conducted across 14 different countries. These data were collected using a research grant from the United States Department of Defense's Minerva Research Initiative. All of the individual-level variables we use in the analysis are from this original data set. With the exception of the outcome variables we use to assess attitudes towards different U.S. actors, all of the variables used in the models retain their original forms as described in the survey. The outcome variables are condensed into general categories indicating whether or not respondents express a 1) positive, 2) negative, 3) neutral, or 4) don't know/decline to answer response. We used the first year of these data in our earlier research on the subject (see @Allen2020) We provide more details in the main text.

We also use a variety of country-level variables in our models, described below. 

First, we measure the respondent's country's level of democracy using data from the Varieties of Democracy Project [@VDemV111; @Vdemcodebook2021]. Specifically, we use the `v2x_polyarchy` variable. This variable is a composite of other indicator variables that code various aspects of a country's democratic performance. This variable runs from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating more democratic countries and lower values indicating less democratic countries. 

Second, we also include variables that measure the country's total population and its gross domestic product (GDP). We obtain these data from the World Bank's World Development Indicators dataset using the `{wbstats}` software package for R [@wdidata2021; @piburn2020]. Specifically, we use the SP.POP.TOTL and NY.GDP.MKTP.KD variables. 

Third, we include measures of the number of U.S. military personnel deployed to the host country in a given year. To generate these values we use data obtained from the `{troopdata}` software package for R [@allenflynnmartinezmachain2022]. These data originally come from the Defense Manpower Data Center and were initially compiled by @Kane2004.

Fourth, we include a count of the number of U.S. military bases within each region of the host country. We generate these variables using data from David Vine [Vine2015] contained in the `{troopdata}` package. We used the `{raster}` software package in R [@hijmans2022] to generate shapefiles using the Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM) [@GADM2021]. We then use the `{sp}` software package to check for overlap between base locations and administrative regions. We then take the sum of the base locations that fall within each administrative area.

When running our models we use a standardized version of each of these variables. Specifically, this means that each value is divided by two standard deviations. While this can offer a number of benefits in interpreting variables (see @Gelman2008) this approach also provides computational advantages by rescaling the predictor variables and reducing the variability in their range.

### Further Discussions from Chapter 3

Before moving on to the next section, Figure \ref{fig:priorcomparison} compares the prior probability distributions used in our models, which represent our beliefs about the relationship between contact and perceptions using only 2018 the data from our previous research, to the posterior distributions, which represent the our beliefs about the relationship between our key variables, given our full sample of data.[@Allen2020] This figure can help us understand how much our findings have changed as a result of including two additional years of surveys in our analysis. The larger points represent the prior values, and the smaller ones represent the posterior estimates from the models in this chapter. The different colors of the points correspond to the respondents' assessments of the US military, government, and people. The overall structure of the figure is similar to that of Figure \ref{fig:coefplot1}, but to streamline the presentation and focus on the most relevant quantities, we only include the values corresponding to the ``yes'' responses for the contact and benefit variables. 

```{r priorcomparison, echo = FALSE, height = 8, width = 9}
knitr::include_graphics("../Book/Figures/Chapter-Contact/figure-coefficient-prior-comparison.png")
```

In general, the results of our current analysis largely reflect the results of the previous analysis. The priors and posteriors for the positive and negative responses are reasonably close to one another. When we focus only on the positive and negative response categories, we see that in roughly two-thirds of the coefficient estimates, the current analysis produces slightly smaller coefficient estimates than in our previous study. To put it differently, in many cases, the addition of the new data appears to have pulled the coefficients in towards 0, producing smaller absolute values of the estimates. In the remaining cases, the updated estimates are roughly equivalent to the prior values or larger. However, these differences are fairly small across the board.

Where we see greater levels of divergence, it tends to be in the estimates of the "don't know/decline" response categories. Further, in these cases, the current analysis generally produces smaller coefficient values for this response category. A smaller coefficient indicates that, across the different contact\index{contact} and benefit questions, individuals who respond "yes" to these questions are less different from those who responded "no" when giving a "don't know/decline" response than our first analysis suggested.
