# Summary {-}

This bookdown project contains additional supplementary information for the contents of our book, Beyond the Wire: US Military Deployments and the Diplomacy of Defense. The materials contained within include additional information on surveys, tables for the models presented in the book, additional figures, code for figures and tables, etc.

In general we try to keep this fairly light on code. You can find all of the code used to create the book in Michael Flynn's GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/meflynn/troops-book).

This supplementary appendix generally follows the layout of the book and is comprised of separate chapters that contain information from the corresponding book chapter, with the exception of the theory chapter, which is largely lacking any data or accompanying code. The general layout is as follows:

1. Introduction
2. Domain of Consent
3. Deployments and Contact
4. Deployments and Crime
5. Deployments and Minority Populations
6. Deployments and Protests
7. Domain of Competitive Consent

All remaining errors are our own.
