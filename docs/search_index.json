A. Allen, Michael E. Flynn, Carla Martinez Machain, and Andrew Stravers 2022-11-03 Summary This bookdown project contains additional supplementary information for the contents of our book, Beyond the Wire: US Military Deployments and the Diplomacy of Defense. The materials contained within include additional information on surveys, tables for the models presented in the book, additional figures, code for figures and tables, etc. In general, we try to annotate the code to help users understand the various decisions we made throughout. Given the length of the manuscript and the sheer volume of code a line-by-line annotation isn’t currently possible, but we will will provide a generally summary of denser material and highlight particular lines at more critical points in the workflow. Also note that we try to load the appropriate libraries at the beginning of each appendix chapter, but some of these may be redundant or unused in the final iteration of the chapter. In many cases we also call the library as a part of the function call to ensure reproducability and avoid errors resulting from mistakenly calling a function from a different package (e.g. {plyr::summarize} rather than {dplyr::summarize}). This supplementary appendix generally follows the layout of the book and is comprised of separate chapters that contain information from the corresponding book chapter, with the exception of the theory chapter, which is largely lacking any data or accompanying code. The general layout is as follows: Introduction Domain of Consent Deployments and Contact Deployments and Crime Deployments and Minority Populations Deployments and Protests Domain of Competitive Consent All remaining errors are our own. "],["introduction.html", "Chapter A.1 Introduction", " Chapter A.1 Introduction The first chapter of the book largely focuses on providing background information on the project and exposition for the substance of the book. There are two figures displaying the location of US military personnel at two points in time (2005 and 2020). Note that the one thing I changed on this page is the base size for the font. In the book it’s set to 30, but this is necessary to get the figures to render properly given the output size. Here I’ve set the base size to 12 to achieve a more appropriate scaling. This also seems to be sensitive to whether you’re using a Mac or Windows, so just a heads-up that getting this to render properly may require some tweaks on your end depending on your operating system. # Load libraries for itnroductory chapter library(tidyverse) library(tidyr) library(cshapes) library(maps) library(countrycode) library(scales) library(here) library(sf) library(rnaturalearth) library(rworldmap) library(viridis) library(sysfonts) library(showtext) library(knitr) # Set resolution to 400 knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = &#39;&#39;, dpi = 400) # Use custom font from Google fonts sysfonts::font_add_google(&quot;Oswald&quot;, family = &quot;oswald&quot;) showtext::showtext_auto() # Set base font size for custom theme basesize &lt;- 11 # Note this changed from book # Set custom theme theme_flynn_map &lt;- function(){ theme_void(base_family = &quot;oswald&quot;, base_size = basesize) %+replace% theme(plot.title = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;, size = basesize, hjust = 0, margin = margin(t = 0, b = 0.3, l = 0, r = 0, unit = &quot;cm&quot;)), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = basesize * 0.85, hjust = 0, margin = margin(t = 0, b = 0.3, l = 0, r = 0, unit = &quot;cm&quot;)), plot.caption = element_text(face = &quot;italic&quot;, size = basesize * 0.65, hjust = 1, margin = margin(t = 0.2, unit = &quot;cm&quot;)), plot.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;white&quot;, color = &quot;white&quot;), strip.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;gray80&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;), strip.text = element_text(color = &quot;black&quot;, face = &quot;bold&quot;), panel.grid.major = element_line(color = &quot;white&quot;, size = 0), panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = &quot;white&quot;, size = 0), #axis.title = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;, size = 0), #axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0, r = 0.5, b = 0, l = 0, unit = &quot;cm&quot;)), #axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0.5, r = 0, b = 0, l = 0, unit = &quot;cm&quot;)), legend.title = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;, lineheight = 1.2), legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;, legend.key.height = unit(0.6, &quot;cm&quot;), legend.key.width = unit(2.5, &quot;cm&quot;)) } # Set Seed SEED &lt;- 66502 set.seed(seed = SEED) # Use the troopdata function to obtain deployment data for 1950. troop.data &lt;- troopdata::get_troopdata(startyear = 1950, endyear = 1950) %&gt;% # Remove US from data filter(ccode != 2) %&gt;% # Change West Germany&#39;s code from 260 to 255 mutate(ccode = ifelse(ccode == 260, 255, ccode)) Warning: Data include troop values for unknown locations and personnel listed as &#39;afloat&#39;. # Use naturalearth package to create basemap. map.base &lt;- rnaturalearth::ne_countries(returnclass = &quot;sf&quot;) # Use cshapes package to generate COW system data for 1950 map.1950 &lt;- cshp(date = as.Date(&quot;1950-01-01&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(., ccode = countrycode::countrycode(gwcode, &quot;gwn&quot;, &quot;cown&quot;)) %&gt;% left_join(troop.data, by = &quot;ccode&quot;) Warning in countrycode_convert(sourcevar = sourcevar, origin = origin, destination = dest, : Some values were not matched unambiguously: 711 # Use ggplot and sf packages to create map of 1950 deployments # Lay down base map first then deployments # Note the application of the coordinate reference system below to alter projection from default ggplot() + geom_sf(data = map.base, aes(geometry = geometry), fill = &quot;gray90&quot;, color = &quot;gray90&quot;, size = 0.1) + geom_sf(data = map.1950, aes(geometry = geometry, fill = troops), color = &quot;white&quot;, size = 0.1) + theme_flynn_map() + theme(legend.text = element_text(size = basesize*1.05, margin = margin(t = -6, unit = &quot;pt&quot;)), legend.title = element_text(size = basesize*1.1, lineheight = 0.3), plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0)) + viridis::scale_fill_viridis(option = &quot;magma&quot;, direction = -1, begin = 0.1, end = 0.9, na.value = &quot;gray90&quot;, breaks = c(0, 20, 200, 2000, 20000, 200000), limits = c(0, 200000), trans = &quot;log1p&quot;, label = comma_format()) + coord_sf(crs = st_crs(&quot;ESRI:54030&quot;)) + labs(fill = &quot;Deployment\\nSize&quot;) # As above, use troopdata package to get deployment data for 2020.

Please note that we recode these variables when we estimate our categorical logit models. For our primary models we collapse the six original categories down into four: 1) Positive views, 2) Negative views, 3) Neutral views, and 4) Don’t know/Decline to answer. This approach has a couple of advantages. First, while we prefer to collect data at a fine-grained level, we have little empirical or theoretical basis for evaluating the substantive difference between the “Somewhat” and “Very” categories. However, there is a clearer and more meaningful distinction between positive and negative views. Second, the simpler saves us a considerable amount of time given the computational intensity of the multilevel categorical models, which we discuss more below. 3 - Question: US Military Presence (troops_1) “In general, what is your opinion of the presence of American military forces in (respondent’s country)?” Values: 1 - Don’t know/decline to answer 2 - Very favorable 3 - Somewhat favorable 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat unfavorable 6 - Very unfavorable 4 - Question: American Government (american_gov) “In general, what is your opinion of the American government?” Values: 1 - Don’t know/decline to answer 2 - Very favorable 3 - Somewhat favorable 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat unfavorable 6 - Very unfavorable 5 - Question: American People (american_people) “In general, what is your opinion of the American people?” Values: 1 - Don’t know/decline to answer 2 - Very favorable 3 - Somewhat favorable 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat unfavorable 6 - Very unfavorable 2.1.2 Independent Variables These variables represent either data coded automatically by our survey services or questions we asked the respondents. Note that almost all of these variables are treated as categorical/factor variables when estimating the models, and that the category numbers do not denote treatment as a continuous measure. 6 - Question: Direct Contact with US Military (contact_pers) “Have you personally had direct contact with a member of the American military in (respondent’s country)?” Values: 1 - Yes 2 - No 3 - Don’t know/Decline to answer 7 - Question: Family Contact with US Military (contact_nonpers) “Has a member of your family or close friend had direct contact with a member of the American military stationed in (respondent’s country)?” Values: 1 - Yes 2 - No 3 - Don’t know/Decline to answer 8 - Question: Economic benefit US Military (benefit_pers) “Have you personally received a direct economic benefit from the American military presence in (respondent’s country)?

Values: 0-99999 Note: Given a number of extreme outliers resulting from the open form/self-coding process we used in our surveys, we truncate the education variable at 25 years when we estimate our models to eliminate extreme outliers. This covers up to 9 years of graduate education. 13 - Question: Age What is your age? Values: 0-99999 14 - Question: Income - Schmeidl (incomesm) What is your total household income during the past 12 months? This question had six response categories for each of the six countries, which is the following. All categories are combined as 1-6 in the data.

Color coding indicates which survey firm fielded the surveys in a given country. Summary statistics detailing breakdown of views. One detail that we wanted to convey in the book was just how out of step views of the US government often are compared with views of US military personnel and the American people. Figure 2.2 shows these differences by showing the percent of people in each country who responded with a favorable or unfavorable view of the group listed on the X axis. Figure 2.2: Favorable and Unfavorable views of US actors. Categories aggregated to favorable and unfavorable based on a response of ‘Somewhat’ or ‘Very’. For more detail how the countries vary in terms of reported forms of contact and benefits, Table 2.1 shows the proportion of people responding “Yes” in each country when asked about their contact experience or whether they receive personal economic benefits from a US military presence, or if they know someone who receives such an economic benefit.

We provide additional information here detailing the specifications of these different models, including data sources and transformations. The opinion data we use come from a three-year long series of public opinion surveys conducted across 14 different countries. These data were collected using a research grant from the United States Department of Defense’s Minerva Research Initiative. All of the individual-level variables we use in the analysis are from this original data set. With the exception of the outcome variables we use to assess attitudes towards different U.S. actors, all of the variables used in the models retain their original forms as described in the survey. The outcome variables are condensed into general categories indicating whether or not respondents express a 1) positive, 2) negative, 3) neutral, or 4) don’t know/decline to answer response. We used the first year of these data in our earlier research on the subject (see Michael A. Allen et al. (2020)) We provide more details in the main text. We also use a variety of country-level variables in our models, described below. First, we measure the respondent’s country’s level of democracy using data from the Varieties of Democracy Project (Coppedge, Gerring, Knutsen, Lindberg, Teorell, Alizada, et al. 2021; Coppedge, Gerring, Knutsen, Lindberg, Teorell, Altman, et al. 2021). Specifically, we use the v2x_polyarchy variable. This variable is a composite of other indicator variables that code various aspects of a country’s democratic performance. This variable runs from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating more democratic countries and lower values indicating less democratic countries. Second, we also include variables that measure the country’s total population and its gross domestic product (GDP). We obtain these data from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators dataset using the {wbstats} software package for R (Group 2021; Piburn, n.d.). Specifically, we use the SP.POP.TOTL and NY.GDP.MKTP.KD variables. Third, we include measures of the number of U.S. military personnel deployed to the host country in a given year. To generate these values we use data obtained from the {troopdata} software package for R (Michael A. Allen, Flynn, and Machain, n.d.). These data originally come from the Defense Manpower Data Center and were initially compiled by Kane (2004). Fourth, we include a count of the number of U.S. military bases within each region of the host country. We generate these variables using data from David Vine [Vine2015] contained in the {troopdata} package. We used the {raster} software package in R (Hijmans 2022) to generate shapefiles using the Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM) (Global Administrative Areas 2021). We then use the {sp} software package to check for overlap between base locations and administrative regions. We then take the sum of the base locations that fall within each administrative area. When running our models we use a standardized version of each of these variables. Specifically, this means that each value is divided by two standard deviations. While this can offer a number of benefits in interpreting variables (see Gelman (n.d.)) this approach also provides computational advantages by rescaling the predictor variables and reducing the variability in their range. 2.3.2 Further Discussions from Chapter 3 Before moving on to the next section, Figure \\(\\ref{fig:priorcomparison}\\) compares the prior probability distributions used in our models, which represent our beliefs about the relationship between contact and perceptions using only 2018 the data from our previous research, to the posterior distributions, which represent the our beliefs about the relationship between our key variables, given our full sample of data.(Michael A. Allen et al. 2020) This figure can help us understand how much our findings have changed as a result of including two additional years of surveys in our analysis. The larger points represent the prior values, and the smaller ones represent the posterior estimates from the models in this chapter. The different colors of the points correspond to the respondents’ assessments of the US military, government, and people. The overall structure of the figure is similar to that of Figure \\(\\ref{fig:coefplot1}\\), but to streamline the presentation and focus on the most relevant quantities, we only include the values corresponding to the ``yes’’ responses for the contact and benefit variables. In general, the results of our current analysis largely reflect the results of the previous analysis. The priors and posteriors for the positive and negative responses are reasonably close to one another. When we focus only on the positive and negative response categories, we see that in roughly two-thirds of the coefficient estimates, the current analysis produces slightly smaller coefficient estimates than in our previous study. To put it differently, in many cases, the addition of the new data appears to have pulled the coefficients in towards 0, producing smaller absolute values of the estimates. In the remaining cases, the updated estimates are roughly equivalent to the prior values or larger. However, these differences are fairly small across the board. Where we see greater levels of divergence, it tends to be in the estimates of the “don’t know/decline” response categories. Further, in these cases, the current analysis generally produces smaller coefficient values for this response category. A smaller coefficient indicates that, across the different contact and benefit questions, individuals who respond “yes” to these questions are less different from those who responded “no” when giving a “don’t know/decline” response than our first analysis suggested. 2.3.3 Prior Specification Tables Table 2.2: Priors specifications for Troops contact models. prior class coef group resp dpar nlpar

Mirroring the main manuscript, we will first present supplementary information on the micro-level protest section and then present supplementary information on the macro-level protest section. 5.1 Micro-Level Protest The individual-level models consist of four separate models that build on one another. We Our focus here is to better understand the individual correlates of protest but also to understand the overall predictive performance of the models. More specifically, while we expect that the models will generally provide a better prediction with the addition of more predictor variables, we are interested in the relative gains from adding particular “blocks” of predictors. These blocks are described in the table below.
