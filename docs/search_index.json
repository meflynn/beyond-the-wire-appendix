Mirroring the main manuscript, we will first present supplementary information on the micro-level protest section and then present supplementary information on the macro-level protest section. 6.1 Micro-Level Protest The individual-level models consist of four separate models that build on one another. We Our focus here is to better understand the individual correlates of protest but also to understand the overall predictive performance of the models. More specifically, while we expect that the models will generally provide a better prediction with the addition of more predictor variables, we are interested in the relative gains from adding particular “blocks” of predictors. These blocks are described in the table below. Table 6.1: Predictive Model Specification for Individual Protest Activity Base Model Demographics Demographics and Attitudes Demographics, Attitudes, and Experiences Base Count Age Age Age GDP Education Education Education Population Ideology Ideology Ideology Troops in country Gender Gender Gender Income Income Income Minority Status Minority Status Minority Status Base Count Attitude towards US military presence Attitude towards US military presence GDP Assessment of US influence (Quantity) Personal contact Population Assessment of US influence (Quality) Network Contact Troops in country Base Count Personal benefits GDP Network benefits Population Personal experience with troops and crime Troops in country Network experience with crime Assessment of US influence (Quantity) Assessment of US influence (Quality) Base Count GDP Population Troops in country 1 Each model include varyings intercepts for country and year. All models also include the primary predictor variables as varying coefficients across the country grouping. In each of these models we estimate both population average or “fixed” effects, and also estimate varying effects for the primary predictors by country. This means that we are relaxing the assumption that there is a constant relationship between predictor variables and protest across countries.1 Table 6.1 provides an overview of the specifications of these five models. The varying coefficients vary by country only and not by year. Our focus in using these models is to assess how good they are at predicting actual protest behavior. To do this, we divide our data into two samples: a training sample and a test sample This step helps to ensure that we are not overfitting our model to the particular data that we have collected. In other words, it ensures that the model is indeed a general one and not just one that works only with the data from the specific individuals we surveyed. This step also allows us to assess how well our model can predict protest when we test it out on “new” data that were not used to estimate the model (the “test sample” that we referred to earlier). Because we know some characteristics of the underlying populations, we group our opinion data according to the individual representative characteristics (age, income, gender, and respondent’s country). We then randomly assign 80% of the observations to the training data and the remaining 20% to the test data. Given the relative infrequency of some response categories for questions like religious or gender self-identification, we opted to give more weight to the training data in order to give the model more information. This ensures that both the training data and the test data are representative of these same variables. We use the training data to fit the models we present below. Once we fit the models, we use the test data to assess how accurate the models are at predicting protest. In the main text we present a series of initial predictive diagnostics. When assessing the primary models we predict protest responses as being a “Yes” if the median predicted probability value is \\(\\geq\\) 0.50 and “No” if the median value is less than this threshold. This represents a fairly conservative assessment tool, but in this appendix we explore alternative prediction thresholds. To put it differently, setting too high a barrier for inclusion in the “Yes” category is also problematic as it means we miss an increasingly large share of cases. There are practical considerations in devising such a threshold as well. For example, if we found that the true probability of protesting were to be a 10% chance, then we would be wrong nine of ten times. However, our model provides information that these cases stand out from even lower-probability observations. Part of the decision calculus in choosing a threshold is judging the utility of having more false-positive or false-negatives and how that informs decision-making or policymaking. If a policymaker wants to guard against protests, then increasing the number of false positives to capture the true positives is worthwhile. However, if the event itself is non-consequential or involves a severe policy response, then we should up our threshold and accept a higher number of false negatives. For example, suppose individuals who did not protest were subject to intensive surveillance or harassment because authorities believed they were involved in protests. In that case, this sort of policy response could easily backfire and become a self-fulfilling prophecy that makes protest behavior more likely. Looking at Table ??, we can see that lower classification thresholds generate relatively comparable figures for specificity and overall correct predictions across all models while yielding much better performance on the sensitivity metric. Using a lower probability threshold for determining which observations fall into the ``Yes’’ category can thus improve overall predictive accuracy. 6.2 Macro-Level Protest 6.3 Protest DAG The Test We add an additional layer of flexibility to the models by allowing correlation between all of the varying or ``random’’ effects to vary as well. This relaxes the assumption that the correlation between these effects is 0 and allows the model to estimate each instead.↩︎ "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
