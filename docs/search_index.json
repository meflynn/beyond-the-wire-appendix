A. Allen, Michael E. Flynn, Carla Martinez Machain, and Andrew Stravers 2022-12-03 Summary This bookdown project contains additional supplementary information for the contents of our book, Beyond the Wire: US Military Deployments and the Diplomacy of Defense. The materials contained within include additional information on surveys, tables for the models presented in the book, additional figures, code for figures and tables, etc. In general we try to keep this fairly light on code. You can find all of the code used to create the book in Michael Flynn’s GitHub repository here. This supplementary appendix generally follows the layout of the book and is comprised of separate chapters that contain information from the corresponding book chapter, with the exception of the theory chapter, which is largely lacking any data or accompanying code. The general layout is as follows: Introduction Domain of Consent Deployments and Contact Deployments and Crime Deployments and Minority Populations Deployments and Protests Domain of Competitive Consent All remaining errors are our own. "],["introduction.html", "Chapter A.1 Introduction", " Chapter A.1 Introduction The first chapter of the book largely focuses on providing background information on the project and exposition for the substance of the book. There are two figures displaying the location of US military personnel at two points in time (2005 and 2020). Note that the one thing I changed on this page is the base size for the font. In the book it’s set to 30, but this is necessary to get the figures to render properly given the output size. Here I’ve set the base size to 12 to achieve a more appropriate scaling. This also seems to be sensitive to whether you’re using a Mac or Windows, so just a heads-up that getting this to render properly may require some tweaks on your end depending on your operating system. # Load libraries for itnroductory chapter library(tidyverse) library(tidyr) library(cshapes) library(maps) library(countrycode) library(scales) library(here) library(sf) library(rnaturalearth) library(rworldmap) library(viridis) library(sysfonts) library(showtext) library(knitr) # Set resolution to 400 knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = &#39;&#39;, dpi = 400) # Use custom font from Google fonts sysfonts::font_add_google(&quot;Oswald&quot;, family = &quot;oswald&quot;) showtext::showtext_auto() # Set base font size for custom theme basesize &lt;- 11 # Note this changed from book # Set custom theme theme_flynn_map &lt;- function(){ theme_void(base_family = &quot;oswald&quot;, base_size = basesize) %+replace% theme(plot.title = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;, size = basesize, hjust = 0, margin = margin(t = 0, b = 0.3, l = 0, r = 0, unit = &quot;cm&quot;)), plot.subtitle = element_text(size = basesize * 0.85, hjust = 0, margin = margin(t = 0, b = 0.3, l = 0, r = 0, unit = &quot;cm&quot;)), plot.caption = element_text(face = &quot;italic&quot;, size = basesize * 0.65, hjust = 1, margin = margin(t = 0.2, unit = &quot;cm&quot;)), plot.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;white&quot;, color = &quot;white&quot;), strip.background = element_rect(fill = &quot;gray80&quot;, color = &quot;black&quot;), strip.text = element_text(color = &quot;black&quot;, face = &quot;bold&quot;), panel.grid.major = element_line(color = &quot;white&quot;, size = 0), panel.grid.minor = element_line(color = &quot;white&quot;, size = 0), #axis.title = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;, size = 0), #axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0, r = 0.5, b = 0, l = 0, unit = &quot;cm&quot;)), #axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0.5, r = 0, b = 0, l = 0, unit = &quot;cm&quot;)), legend.title = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;, lineheight = 1.2), legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;, legend.key.height = unit(0.6, &quot;cm&quot;), legend.key.width = unit(2.5, &quot;cm&quot;)) } # Set Seed SEED &lt;- 66502 set.seed(seed = SEED) # Use the troopdata function to obtain deployment data for 1950. troop.data &lt;- troopdata::get_troopdata(startyear = 1950, endyear = 1950) %&gt;% # Remove US from data filter(ccode != 2) %&gt;% # Change West Germany&#39;s code from 260 to 255 mutate(ccode = ifelse(ccode == 260, 255, ccode)) Warning: Data include troop values for unknown locations and personnel listed as &#39;afloat&#39;. # Use naturalearth package to create basemap. map.base &lt;- rnaturalearth::ne_countries(returnclass = &quot;sf&quot;) # Use cshapes package to generate COW system data for 1950 map.1950 &lt;- cshp(date = as.Date(&quot;1950-01-01&quot;)) %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(., ccode = countrycode::countrycode(gwcode, &quot;gwn&quot;, &quot;cown&quot;)) %&gt;% left_join(troop.data, by = &quot;ccode&quot;) Warning in countrycode_convert(sourcevar = sourcevar, origin = origin, destination = dest, : Some values were not matched unambiguously: 711 # Use ggplot and sf packages to create map of 1950 deployments # Lay down base map first then deployments # Note the application of the coordinate reference system below to alter projection from default ggplot() + geom_sf(data = map.base, aes(geometry = geometry), fill = &quot;gray90&quot;, color = &quot;gray90&quot;, size = 0.1) + geom_sf(data = map.1950, aes(geometry = geometry, fill = troops), color = &quot;white&quot;, size = 0.1) + theme_flynn_map() + theme(legend.text = element_text(size = basesize*1.05, margin = margin(t = -6, unit = &quot;pt&quot;)), legend.title = element_text(size = basesize*1.1, lineheight = 0.3), plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0)) + viridis::scale_fill_viridis(option = &quot;magma&quot;, direction = -1, begin = 0.1, end = 0.9, na.value = &quot;gray90&quot;, breaks = c(0, 20, 200, 2000, 20000, 200000), limits = c(0, 200000), trans = &quot;log1p&quot;, label = comma_format()) + coord_sf(crs = st_crs(&quot;ESRI:54030&quot;)) + labs(fill = &quot;Deployment\\nSize&quot;) # As above, use troopdata package to get deployment data for 2020.

Please note that we recode these variables when we estimate our categorical logit models. For our primary models we collapse the six original categories down into four: 1) Positive views, 2) Negative views, 3) Neutral views, and 4) Don’t know/Decline to answer. This approach has a couple of advantages. First, while we prefer to collect data at a fine-grained level, we have little empirical or theoretical basis for evaluating the substantive difference between the “Somewhat” and “Very” categories. However, there is a clearer and more meaningful distinction between positive and negative views. Second, the simpler saves us a considerable amount of time given the computational intensity of the multilevel categorical models, which we discuss more below. 3 - Question: US Military Presence (troops_1) “In general, what is your opinion of the presence of American military forces in (respondent’s country)?” Values: 1 - Don’t know/decline to answer 2 - Very favorable 3 - Somewhat favorable 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat unfavorable 6 - Very unfavorable 4 - Question: American Government (american_gov) “In general, what is your opinion of the American government?” Values: 1 - Don’t know/decline to answer 2 - Very favorable 3 - Somewhat favorable 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat unfavorable 6 - Very unfavorable 5 - Question: American People (american_people) “In general, what is your opinion of the American people?” Values: 1 - Don’t know/decline to answer 2 - Very favorable 3 - Somewhat favorable 4 - Neutral 5 - Somewhat unfavorable 6 - Very unfavorable 2.1.2 Independent Variables These variables represent either data coded automatically by our survey services or questions we asked the respondents. Note that almost all of these variables are treated as categorical/factor variables when estimating the models, and that the category numbers do not denote treatment as a continuous measure. 6 - Question: Direct Contact with US Military (contact_pers) “Have you personally had direct contact with a member of the American military in (respondent’s country)?” Values: 1 - Yes 2 - No 3 - Don’t know/Decline to answer 7 - Question: Family Contact with US Military (contact_nonpers) “Has a member of your family or close friend had direct contact with a member of the American military stationed in (respondent’s country)?” Values: 1 - Yes 2 - No 3 - Don’t know/Decline to answer 8 - Question: Economic benefit US Military (benefit_pers) “Have you personally received a direct economic benefit from the American military presence in (respondent’s country)?

Our initial rules for inclusion were based on a count of the countries that had an average of \\(\\geq100\\) U.S. military personnel per year deployed within their borders since 1990. This yielded a fairly large initial sample of 34 countries. From this list we further identified the countries that had average annual deployment levels \\(\\geq\\) 10,000 U.S. military personnel (the United Kingdoacm, Germany, Italy, South Korea, and Japan). We added Kuwait to this list as the value fell just below the 10,000 threshold. From there we proceeded to include other countries where the U.S. military presence was likely to be large enough to elicit a reaction from the public, thereby providing the variation we need the conduct our survey. We also focused on countries where the U.S. military had a historically notable presence, or cases that were of contemporary relevance. For example, the average value for the Philippines is only 1,042 but the the long historical presence of U.S. military facilities in the Philippines, as well as that country’s status as a former colony, makes it an attractive case. Alternatively, Poland has an average score of 28 U.S. personnel since 1990, but with recent Russian aggression and the increase in U.S. personnel deployed to Poland, this is a case that is of great contemporary relevance for our analysis as it will help us to look at attitudes towards U.S. military personnel in a country that does not have a long-term history of hosting such deployments. Other cases, like Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands, and Portugal allow us to assess variation in attitudes among countries that share a relatively similar geographic and political history, as well as countries who all belong to NATO. Further, countries like Portugal provide us with an opportunity to explore how variation in the type of U.S. military personnel affects attitudes, as it receives mostly Navy personnel as compared to the Army-heavy deployments in countries Germany. Finally, there is a notable lack of countries represented in Africa and South America. This is for a couple of reasons. First, the only country in South America with a notable history of hosting U.S. military personnel is Panama. However, this is largely due to a brief spike in deployments following the U.S. invasion. In general, most Latin American countries have not played host to large long-term deployments in the way that countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region have. Those deployments that do occur in Latin America are generally short-term military exercises that tend to occur outside of the public’s view. Though there is some limited interaction with the public during some of these deployments, it is not of the same frequency or intensity as in other cases. Members of our team have addressed the effects of these types of deployments in other work, but we have opted to exclude them from our current survey effort so as to focus on other cases with a history of hosting larger deployments over long periods of time. However, we have conducted fieldwork in two Latin American countries as a part of this project—Panama and Peru. Panama is of clear historic importance given both the Canal and the U.S. invasion in 1989; Peru has hosted multiple rounds of military exercises conducted by the U.S. military in conjunction with other partner countries throughout Latin American on an annual basis. In each case we interviewed U.S. military personnel, local politicians, journalists, and policymakers in an effort to better understand the nature of the U.S. military’s activities in these countries, as well as how the U.S. military relates to the host-state public. Given the smaller and more episodic nature of the deployments, we believe these interviews were a more effective approach for covering Latin America than the use of large-N surveys. Similarly, U.S. longer-term deployments in Africa are relatively new, but most are still relatively small in scale. None of the countries on our base list counting those that averaged \\(\\geq\\) 100 personnel per year were in Africa. Furthermore, those that are currently in Africa tend to be oriented towards military training and counter-terror operations. Unlike the larger deployments in Western Europe, these deployments are smaller and more focused in purpose, and do not tend to interact with the host-state population in the ways that deployments in other regions historically have. Figure 2.1: Map of countries included in the survey. Color coding indicates which survey firm fielded the surveys in a given country. 2.3 Additional Descriptive Information One detail that we wanted to convey in the book was just how out of step views of the US government often are compared with views of US military personnel and the American people. Figure 2.2 shows these differences by showing the percent of people in each country who responded with a favorable or unfavorable view of the group listed on the X axis. Figure 2.2: Favorable and Unfavorable views of US actors. Categories aggregated to favorable and unfavorable based on a response of ‘Somewhat’ or ‘Very’. For more detail how the countries vary in terms of reported forms of contact and benefits, Table 2.1 shows the proportion of people responding “Yes” in each country when asked about their contact experience or whether they receive personal economic benefits from a US military presence, or if they know someone who receives such an economic benefit.

We provide additional information here detailing the specifications of these different models, including data sources and transformations. The opinion data we use come from a three-year long series of public opinion surveys conducted across 14 different countries. These data were collected using a research grant from the United States Department of Defense’s Minerva Research Initiative. All of the individual-level variables we use in the analysis are from this original data set. With the exception of the outcome variables we use to assess attitudes towards different U.S. actors, all of the variables used in the models retain their original forms as described in the survey. The outcome variables are condensed into general categories indicating whether or not respondents express a 1) positive, 2) negative, 3) neutral, or 4) don’t know/decline to answer response. We used the first year of these data in our earlier research on the subject (see Michael A. Allen et al. (2020)) We provide more details in the main text. We also use a variety of country-level variables in our models, described below. First, we measure the respondent’s country’s level of democracy using data from the Varieties of Democracy Project (Coppedge, Gerring, Knutsen, Lindberg, Teorell, Alizada, et al. 2021; Coppedge, Gerring, Knutsen, Lindberg, Teorell, Altman, et al. 2021). Specifically, we use the v2x_polyarchy variable. This variable is a composite of other indicator variables that code various aspects of a country’s democratic performance. This variable runs from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating more democratic countries and lower values indicating less democratic countries. Second, we also include variables that measure the country’s total population and its gross domestic product (GDP). We obtain these data from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators dataset using the {wbstats} software package for R (Group 2021; Piburn, n.d.). Specifically, we use the SP.POP.TOTL and NY.GDP.MKTP.KD variables. Third, we include measures of the number of U.S. military personnel deployed to the host country in a given year. To generate these values we use data obtained from the {troopdata} software package for R (Michael A. Allen, Flynn, and Machain 2021). These data originally come from the Defense Manpower Data Center and were initially compiled by Kane (2004). Fourth, we include a count of the number of U.S. military bases within each region of the host country. We generate these variables using data from David Vine [Vine2015] contained in the {troopdata} package. We used the {raster} software package in R (Hijmans 2022) to generate shapefiles using the Database of Global Administrative Areas (GADM) (Global Administrative Areas 2021). We then use the {sp} software package to check for overlap between base locations and administrative regions. We then take the sum of the base locations that fall within each administrative area. When running our models we use a standardized version of each of these variables. Specifically, this means that each value is divided by two standard deviations. While this can offer a number of benefits in interpreting variables (see Gelman (n.d.)) this approach also provides computational advantages by rescaling the predictor variables and reducing the variability in their range. 2.4.2 Further Discussions from Chapter 3 Before moving on to the next section, Figure @ref{fig:priorcomparison} compares the prior probability distributions used in our models, which represent our beliefs about the relationship between contact and perceptions using only 2018 the data from our previous research, to the posterior distributions, which represent the our beliefs about the relationship between our key variables, given our full sample of data.(Michael A. Allen et al. 2020) This figure can help us understand how much our findings have changed as a result of including two additional years of surveys in our analysis. The larger points represent the prior values, and the smaller ones represent the posterior estimates from the models in this chapter. The different colors of the points correspond to the respondents’ assessments of the US military, government, and people. The overall structure of the figure is similar to that of Figure @ref{fig:coefplot1}, but to streamline the presentation and focus on the most relevant quantities, we only include the values corresponding to the ``yes’’ responses for the contact and benefit variables. In general, the results of our current analysis largely reflect the results of the previous analysis. The priors and posteriors for the positive and negative responses are reasonably close to one another. When we focus only on the positive and negative response categories, we see that in roughly two-thirds of the coefficient estimates, the current analysis produces slightly smaller coefficient estimates than in our previous study. To put it differently, in many cases, the addition of the new data appears to have pulled the coefficients in towards 0, producing smaller absolute values of the estimates. In the remaining cases, the updated estimates are roughly equivalent to the prior values or larger. However, these differences are fairly small across the board. Where we see greater levels of divergence, it tends to be in the estimates of the “don’t know/decline” response categories. Further, in these cases, the current analysis generally produces smaller coefficient values for this response category. A smaller coefficient indicates that, across the different contact and benefit questions, individuals who respond “yes” to these questions are less different from those who responded “no” when giving a “don’t know/decline” response than our first analysis suggested. Our takeaway here is that the results of the updated models are fairly consistent with our earlier modeling efforts. However the addition of new data and the tendency towards slightly smaller estimates suggests that the estimates in our previous models may have 2.4.3 Additional Note The code for these models is available on Michael Flynn’s GitHub repository for the book. I would also direct readers’ to Jordan Nafa’s GitHub repository housing replication information for the 2018 article that preceded the book. Our initial APSR models took about 30 hours per model (times three models). We estimate several more models in the book, and we were able to obtain some efficiency gains and reduce run times by streamlining model specifications and using better and/or informed priors (see Michael A. Allen et al. 2020). Jordan’s code is much more efficient than the code we used to estimate our public opinion models, and he has greatly reduced model run times through a number of modifications to the basic code. I think he was able to get the models to run in about 2 hours per model. For now I’ve just linked to Jordan’s general GitHub repo, but I’ll narrow the link to the specific repo for the replication code when I get it. For now, just know that there are ways to significantly improve upon the basic code we used. 2.4.4 Prior Specification Tables We set the priors on the primary population-level coefficients using the coefficient values from the results of our earlier research on this subject (Michael A. Allen et al. 2020).

"],["minority-chapter.html", "Chapter A.4 US Military Deployments and Minority Communities 4.1 Descriptive Information", " Chapter A.4 US Military Deployments and Minority Communities This chapter provides supplementary information related to Chapter 4 of the book, focusing on how US military deployments interact with and are viewed by minority communities. 4.1 Descriptive Information 4.1.1 Further Discussion from Chapter 5 Comparing the minority variable coefficients with coefficients for the other variables is informative. Also note that the coefficients for the Non-Binary gender identity category throws off the visual scale of the remaining coefficients. First, looking at the age variables, we can see that the older age cohort tends to have a higher likelihood of expressing a positive view of all three US groups than younger age cohorts. Older age cohorts also appear to be less likely to express a negative view of US actors than younger groups, except for views of the US government where we see older age groups more likely to express both positive and negative views. The reference category here is the 18–24 age cohort, meaning that we should evaluate all of the coefficients concerning that baseline. However, we can still compare the coefficient values of the other groups but need to be cautious where there is a significant overlap between the posterior distributions. Individuals with more education appear to be more likely to express both positive and negative views of US actors. However, there is no clear indication that more education correlates with larger differences in negative versus positive views. As we discuss in Chapter 2, this likely reflects a similar process whereby individuals with more education simply have more informed opinions, one way or the other. Regarding gender, individuals identifying as female tend to be less likely to express positive views than those who identify as male. Those individuals identifying as non-binary also appear less likely to express positive views of US actors, and are more likely to express negative views of US troops and the US government, with some indication of a lower probability of expressing negative views of the American people. Finally, when comparing across income quintiles, we find some interesting patterns. First, the baseline category here is the lowest income grouping—the 0–20% quintile. Compared to this group, there is some indication that higher income groups tend to have slightly less favorable views of US military personnel, but these differences appear very small. We find a similar pattern when looking at views of the US government, where only the highest income group shows a slightly positive coefficient value. When looking at views of the US people, groups above the 40% income group appear to have a slightly more positive probability of expressing positive views than the bottom two income categories. We find somewhat similar patterns when looking at negative views. However, we do see larger differences in the probability of expressing negative views among the highest income groups when looking at views of the US government. Though not depicted in this figure, a notable feature of these results is that income appears to correlate quite strongly with a lower probability of respondents saying “Don’t Know/Decline to Answer” when asked about any of the three US groups. Only 2.7% of the highest income groups across all 14 countries replied “Don’t Know/Decline to Answer” when asked about the US military presence in their country. On the other hand, 7.7% of respondents in the lowest income group gave the same response. Like education, income appears to correlate more strongly with more informed opinions instead of clearly lining up with more positive or more negative attitudes. 4.1.2 Prior Specification Tables for

"],["deployments-and-protest-activity.html", "Chapter A.5 Deployments and Protest Activity 5.1 Micro-Level Protest 5.2 Macro-Level Protest", " Chapter A.5 Deployments and Protest Activity This chapter provides supplementary information on the book chapter dealing with individual protest behavior and anti-US protest activity at the aggregate level. Mirroring the main manuscript, we will first present supplementary information on the micro-level protest section and then present supplementary information on the macro-level protest section. 5.1 Micro-Level Protest The individual-level models consist of four separate models that build on one another. We Our focus here is to better understand the individual correlates of protest but also to understand the overall predictive performance of the models. More specifically, while we expect that the models will generally provide a better prediction with the addition of more predictor variables, we are interested in the relative gains from adding particular “blocks” of predictors. These blocks are described in the table below. Table 5.1: Predictive Model Specification for Individual Protest Activity Base Model Demographics Demographics and Attitudes Demographics, Attitudes, and Experiences Base Count Age Age Age GDP Education Education Education Population Ideology Ideology Ideology Troops in country Gender Gender Gender Income Income Income Minority Status Minority Status Minority Status Base Count Attitude towards US military presence Attitude towards US military presence GDP Assessment of US influence (Quantity) Personal contact Population Assessment of US influence (Quality) Network Contact Troops in country Base Count Personal benefits GDP Network benefits Population Personal experience with troops and crime Troops in country Network experience with crime Assessment of US influence (Quantity) Assessment of US influence (Quality) Base Count GDP Population Troops in country 1 Each model include varyings intercepts for country and year. All models also include the primary predictor variables as varying coefficients across the country grouping. In each of these models we estimate both population average or “fixed” effects, and also estimate varying effects for the primary predictors by country. This means that we are relaxing the assumption that there is a constant relationship between predictor variables and protest across countries.1 Table 5.1 provides an overview of the specifications of these five models. The varying coefficients vary by country only and not by year. Our focus in using these models is to assess how good they are at predicting actual protest behavior. To do this, we divide our data into two samples: a training sample and a test sample This step helps to ensure that we are not overfitting our model to the particular data that we have collected. In other words, it ensures that the model is indeed a general one and not just one that works only with the data from the specific individuals we surveyed. This step also allows us to assess how well our model can predict protest when we test it out on “new” data that were not used to estimate the model (the “test sample” that we referred to earlier). Because we know some characteristics of the underlying populations, we group our opinion data according to the individual representative characteristics (age, income, gender, and respondent’s country). We then randomly assign 80% of the observations to the training data and the remaining 20% to the test data. Given the relative infrequency of some response categories for questions like religious or gender self-identification, we opted to give more weight to the training data in order to give the model more information. This ensures that both the training data and the test data are representative of these same variables. We use the training data to fit the models we present below. Once we fit the models, we use the test data to assess how accurate the models are at predicting protest. In the main text we present a series of initial predictive diagnostics. When assessing the primary models we predict protest responses as being a “Yes” if the median predicted probability value is \\(\\geq\\) 0.50 and “No” if the median value is less than this threshold. This represents a fairly conservative assessment tool, but in this appendix we explore alternative prediction thresholds. To put it differently, setting too high a barrier for inclusion in the “Yes” category is also problematic as it means we miss an increasingly large share of cases. There are practical considerations in devising such a threshold as well. For example, if we found that the true probability of protesting were to be a 10% chance, then we would be wrong nine of ten times. However, our model provides information that these cases stand out from even lower-probability observations. Part of the decision calculus in choosing a threshold is judging the utility of having more false-positive or false-negatives and how that informs decision-making or policymaking. If a policymaker wants to guard against protests, then increasing the number of false positives to capture the true positives is worthwhile. However, if the event itself is non-consequential or involves a severe policy response, then we should up our threshold and accept a higher number of false negatives. For example, suppose individuals who did not protest were subject to intensive surveillance or harassment because authorities believed they were involved in protests. In that case, this sort of policy response could easily backfire and become a self-fulfilling prophecy that makes protest behavior more likely. Looking at Table ??, we can see that lower classification thresholds generate relatively comparable figures for specificity and overall correct predictions across all models while yielding much better performance on the sensitivity metric. Using a lower probability threshold for determining which observations fall into the “Yes” category can thus improve overall predictive accuracy. Table @ref{tab:percent-correct-targeted} shows the models’ predictive accuracy when we use 0.10 as the probability threshold for predicting individuals’ protest experience. In general, the overall percent of observations correctly predicted remains fairly high but has declined slightly. We also see the false positive rate has increased, which we should expect from having a much lower threshold. More importantly, the sensitivity score has increased substantially across each model. The minimum here is approximately 41%, with a high of 77%. In other words, using a lower probability threshold, our final model is correctly classifying three-quarters of cases where individuals report having participated in anti-US protest events. Again, this increase does come with a cost. The lower overall rate of correct predictions results from the slight decrease in the correct predictions of ``No’’ responses. The increased false-positive rate also reflects this. Figure 5.1: Receiver operating characteristic curve plot for individual-level protest models. From the curves presented in Figure @ref{fig:protest-roc-plot} we can see that there is indeed substantial variation in model performance when we account for the full range of probability thresholds. Ideally, we would want to see a model’s curve spike up to 100% immediately on the left side of the figure, but none of the models come close to this ideal type. The Intercept Only model performs the worst of the five, as we expect. Again, however, we see substantial improvements as we add demographic variables, and then demographic, attitudinal, and experiential variables. Ss this figure helps to make clearer, the relative performance of the three more complex models—including the one allowing for varying coefficient estimates—is nearly identical, with a very slight edge to the varying coefficient model. Ultimately, all of the models perform better than a simple random assignment mechanism. Still, some are clearly doing a better job of accurately classifying cases of protest involvement while sacrificing less in generating a larger share of false positives. Figure 5.2: Figuring showing the percent predicted correctly, sensitivity, and specificity across different prediction categorization probability thresholds. The disadvantage of the ROC plot is that it obscures the specific probability values and the trade-off between the different aspects of model performance that we seek to maximize. Figure ?? plots the sensitivity, specificity, and percent predicted correctly figures across the range of possible classification probability thresholds. In general, higher probability thresholds make it more difficult for a given observation to make it into the “Yes” category. Conversely, lower thresholds mean that we are more likely to classify observations as “Yes”. This is a seemingly trivial point, but it is worth reiterating because there is nothing special about the 0.50 threshold we use above—it is simply a convention of sorts and seemingly “neutral”. But as we can see from Figure ?? the trade-offs associated with moving between various probability thresholds are not all equal. In this case, our initial na\"{i}ve threshold of 0.50 sacrifices a considerable amount of performance on the sensitivity metric for relatively little gain on the specificity and overall correct prediction metrics. The percent of cases predicted correctly actually starts to decline slightly as we increase the probability threshold. As one last check on our models’ performance, Figure ?? shows the results of a set of posterior predictive checks using the five protest models discussed in this section. We generate 1,000 simulated data sets for each model, each containing simulated predicted Yes/No values for the outcome variable. For each data, set we take the mean value of these predictions, giving us the proportion of each simulated data set where the model predicts individuals to have responded “Yes” to the outcome variable question. The light blue histograms in each panel show the distribution of these predicted proportion values. The dark line shows the actual proportion of “Yes” responses in the real survey data. The narrow bands on the X-axis somewhat mask the fact that the actual distribution of simulated values is fairly narrow in every case. All five models produce reasonably close approximations of the real data, though the mean values are slightly below the actual mean value in every panel except the Intercept Only model. The model including only respondents’ demographic characteristics produces the closest set of simulated values, though with slightly greater dispersion than the other more complex and fully specified models. 5.2 Macro-Level Protest In the book’s main text we show a series of models that examine the predictors of anti-US and anti-US military protest events for a sample of country-years ranging from 1990–2018. We are fundamentally interested in exploring whether the presence of US military forces in another country causes an increase in protest activity directed at the United States, or more narrowly, at the US military forces in the host country. While this may seem obvious, the identification of actual causal effects is a fairly complicated task. The presence of US military forces in a state may coincide with several other types of events that could explain both the US military presence and the outbreak of protests. Furthermore, the outbreak of protests at any given point in time may be driven by an accumulation of historic factors that pre-date the observed time period. Our purpose in this section is to elaborate upon the analytical tools and the process we use to deal with these issues. While the first set of macro-level protest models we present in the book provide a useful starting point in exploring the relationship between the presence of US military deployments and protest activity, we cannot make causal claims on the basis of these results. Basic regression models typically only provide estimates of short-term effects. Further, while the US has a expansive military footprint, the histories of these deployments are highly variable across countries. This can severely bias the estimates from our model as not every country has an equal opportunity of experiencing US military deployments—both in terms of hosting them and the size of those deployments. Finally, as is often the case, the relationship between military deployments and protest events may suffer from confounding effects. Other variables may exert a causal effect on both of our variables of interest. Accordingly, modeling protest events as a function of military deployments and adjusting for many other variables will not yield results that have any meaningful interpretation as causal effects. To address these problems, we estimate a marginal structural model (MSM) to estimate the causal effects of US military deployments on protest (Robins, Hernán, and Brumback 2000; Blackwell and Glynn 2018). These models have a relatively long history of use in fields like biostatistics and epidemiology and can be used to help estimate causal effects in observational studies where exposure to treatments varies across space and time. We can also use this to help us estimate the contemporaneous effect of treatment and the more general effect of a particular treatment history. However, MSMs require us to do some additional work before estimating the effects of troop deployments and their histories on the outcome of interest. There will likely be systematic differences between the individual countries that receive troop deployments or larger deployments and those that receive no or smaller deployments. Figure 5.3: Simplified Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) illustrating the theoretical relationships between the treatment, confounders, and outcome variables. Figure 5.3 presents a directed acyclic graph (DAG) depicting the basic contemporaneous relationships between the variables of interest and their relationships between two time periods, \\(t\\) and \\(t+1\\) (which is the period directly following t). This figure is a bit of a mess, visually speaking, and it can be difficult to navigate the tangle of arrows within time periods. Much of this complexity is also unnecessary to understand the basic intuition that we want to convey, so we present Figure 5.4 to distill these relationships down to some of the most basic and relevant parts. We condense most of the time-variant and time-invariant predictor variables down to the time-invariant covariates (\\(Z\\) terms). We also only present two periods, but the chain of events theoretically runs back to the first observation of \\(t\\) in the series. The light blue node represents the outcome of interest (protests), while the light green node represents the treatment of interest (troops). Any node connected to another indicates a proposed causal relationship, and the direction of the arrow represents the direction of that causal effect Additionally, troop deployments in a given period (what we refer to as time \\(t\\)) are heavily dependent on deployments in the previous period (time \\(t-1\\)). Deployments at time \\(t-1\\) are also likely to affect other predictor variables in subsequent periods. Figure 5.4: Simplified Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) illustrating the theoretical relationships between the treatment, confounders, and outcome variables. These diagrams serve as the starting point for our marginal structural models. Before we can estimate the models we need to ensure that we have a solid theoretical foundation to inform the model’s specification. We will return to discuss the DAGs further below. Now we will discuss the specific procedure for estimating the marginal structural models. The first step in the model building process is to estimate a series of structural weights for each observation for the final regression model to resolve this. We calculate these weights using the formula found Equation @ref{eq:structuralweights}. \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{SW}_{it}=\\prod_{t=1}^{N}\\frac{{{\\hat{Pr}(X_{it}|X_{it-1},\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=2}^{N}x_{t-k},Z_{i})}}}{\\hat{Pr}(X_{it}|X_{it-1},\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=2}^{N}x_{t-k},\\gamma_{it},Z_{i})} \\end{equation}\\] More simply, the weights shown in Equation (??) are a form of propensity score that we can use to re-balance the observations in our data. This is simply a variant of the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method.2 Normally, estimating propensity scores is a relatively straightforward process as it is commonly used to estimate scores in data where the treatment, and often the outcome, are binary (meaning 0 or 1) variables. The fact that our treatment (the number of US troops present in a country) is continuous, meaning that it can, in theory, take on any integer value that is 0 or greater, complicates this process slightly.3 To generate these weights we first have to estimate two separate models wherein troop deployments themselves are the outcome of interest. The first of these models (the numerator) is relatively straightforward to estimate. Here we are running a regression model wherein we predict the size of the troop deployments in country \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\) as a function of a one-unit lag of the troop deployment variable, the cumulative sum of troop deployments in the country \\(i\\) from the beginning of its series up through time \\(t-2\\), and a range of time-invariant covariates, \\(Z\\). In cases where researchers are working with just a binary treatment variable and only a single period, using “1” as the numerator is often all that is required. However, since we are dealing with a continuous treatment variable, generating the numerator using this regression-based approach can help to stabilize the resulting weights by ensuring that the ratios are not enormous (Cole and Hernán 2008). The second model (the denominator) is more complicated. In most respects, it is identical to the numerator, except the gamma (\\(\\gamma\\)) term, which denotes a vector of covariates—the key here is that these covariates have to be sufficient to meet the sequential ignorability criteria. In essence, this requires that there is no unmeasured confounding between the treatment (troops) and the outcome (protests). The language on this point can be confusing given that these techniques were developed across several different literatures and disciplines and compounded by the fact that they often did not speak to one another. To put it in slightly different terms using language from Pearl, this set of covariates must ensure that Pr\\((Y_{it} \\perp X_{it} | \\gamma, Z_{i})\\). That is, the outcome is conditionally independent of the treatment, conditional upon the time-varying covariates (\\(\\gamma\\)) and the time-invariant covariates (\\(Z\\)) (Pearl 2009). We will return to this below, but once we have both of these models, we then generate two sets of predicted values and residuals for each observation in the data set—one using the numerator and one using the denominator. For each set of predictions and residuals, we calculate the probability of the actual observed value of troops in country \\(i\\) at time \\(t\\) using the predictions and the standard deviation of the residuals as the mean and standard deviation of a normal probability density function. We then divide the values generated using the numerator figures by the values generated by the numerator. The actual structural weight for any given observation is the cumulative product of these ratios for country \\(i\\) from the beginning of that country’s series up through time \\(t\\). But, as we note above, estimating the second model is complicated because we need a set of covariates that ensure there is no unmeasured confounding between the treatment and outcome variables. To aid in this process, we turn to another tool—the directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) discussed above. Like with MSMs, scholars from other disciplines have more commonly used DAGs (such as computer science and epidemiology), and they serve a variety of useful purposes. First, they help make explicit the wider array of theorized causal relationships between various predictor variables. Second, assuming a well-developed theoretical model, they can also help to identify sources of confounding and bias.4 Related, they can be used to identify which variables need to be adjusted for in a statistical model to close off the ``back-door’’ paths between the treatment variable and the outcome that serve as the sources of confounding in the model, but also to ensure that we do not adjust for variables that may open up such informational pathways between the treatment and outcome and introduce additional sources of bias (i.e. collider bias) (Pearl 2009; Textor, Zander, and Ankan 2020).5 Using this model as our starting point, we can generate several adjustment sets—variables that will ensure there is no unmeasured confounding when included in the model. Notably, this rests entirely on the notion that we have the “right” theoretical model. We can use many possible adjustment sets given the current model, but they all accomplish the same basic task. If we have included causal relationships in our theoretical model that do not exist, or if we have omitted key causal relationships that do exist, then the implications of the model and our ability to isolate causal effects may change. How these changes would affect our ability to assess the causal relationships we are proposing depends entirely on the specific connections that would change. Assuming for present purposes that our model is sufficient, we can now estimate the denominator described in Equation (??). Once we have calculated the structural weights using this method, we can now estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) of troop deployments on protest activity. To do so, we estimate a series of multilevel negative binomial regressions predicting the number of protests in a country year using the troop deployment variable and treatment history (i.e. the cumulative sum of deployments through time \\(t-2\\)) as predictor variables.6 Notably, these models weight the observations according to the structural weights we calculated above. US military deployments are generally stable within countries, with substantial variation between countries. For example, Germany’s troop levels are high and relatively stable over the period that we study. In other cases, troop levels are low but also relatively stable. There are, however, some cases where troop levels increase and decrease radically at various points throughout 1990–2018. These sudden changes are typically associated with large military operations, like the 1999 war in Kosovo or the 2003 Iraq War. This extreme variability makes estimating the outcome models somewhat difficult because we have extremely large weights for a small set of observations. To address this problem, we estimate the models multiple times using several different truncation points for the weights to better assess the sensitivity of our estimates to the weighted sample. The weights effectively create a pseudo sample of data by replicating observations according to their score. For example, an observation with a score of 4 would be copied four times when we run the model. Given these cases where we see very rapid and extreme changes in US military deployment levels, we encounter a situation where the weights are often enormous (such as weighting scores of 50,000\\(+\\)). There is some question about the proper size of the weights and how to deal with very large or very small weights. Because we are dealing with some exceptionally large weights, we estimate our outcome model multiple times using different truncation points to cut down on the number of extreme values and to assess how sensitive our estimates of the ATE are to changes in the weights.7 Our approach to estimating these models is not perfect, and there are a few issues that readers should make note of. First, we face a tradeoff between estimating multiple models using different IPTW truncation points and estimating a “fully” Bayesian marginal structural model. The latter would involve estimating the outcome model several times to incorporate the uncertainty associated with the propensity scores and weights. We initially attempted to reconcile the two approaches by using the brms_multiple() command to estimate the model several hundred times using a mixture of different truncation points. However, we think this approach is less than ideal because it fails to address the uncertainty arising from the distribution in predicted weights, and treats fundamentally different “datasets” resulting from the truncation caps as interchangeable. Second, one drawback of the large pseudo samples is that the credible intervals around the point estimates are likely incorrect. The pseudo sample literally copies observations in the data set, increasing the overall sample size. This has the effect of reducing the size of the intervals surrounding the point estimates. Andrew Heiss and Jordan Nafa have a working paper that tries to resolve some of these issues. I’d encourage readers to check it out.
